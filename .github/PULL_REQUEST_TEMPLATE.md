<!--
Thank you for contributing to PlasmaPy! Here's a bunch of pointers to
make things easier for all of us:

* If this PR will solve an issue tracked by GitHub, please add a phrase like
  "Closes #404." to automatically close the issue once the pull request is
  merged .  If your PR will not completely solve the issue, please still
  reference the issue. For an overview of this functionality, see
  https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/

* Remember to add some description of your changes in this text box.

* Tests and docstrings are required for new or changed functionality.
  Please make sure tests are passing before requesting a review - they
  will pop up at the bottom, in the Checks box. If you're unsure why
  they're failing, ask!
  
* If your pull request is not yet ready for review, add a `[WIP]`
  label to its name and remove it once it's ready.

* Every pull request should include a changelog entry. Please see
  `changelog/README.rst` for instructions.
  
* If this is your first contribution, please add your name to the author
  list in `docs/about/credits.rst`.
  
* Feel free to chat with other developers on our Matrix channel at:
  https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:matrix.org
  
* We have a developer's guide, where some answers to your questions may
  possibly be found, at
  http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/master/development/index.html

Many thanks in advance for following these pointers and for willing to
contribute!
