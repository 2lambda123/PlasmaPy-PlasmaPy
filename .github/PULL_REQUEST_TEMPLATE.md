<!--
Thank you for contributing to PlasmaPy! Here's a bunch of pointers to
make things easier for all of us:

* If this PR will solve an issue tracked by GitHub, please add
  "Closes #42." for example issue 42 to automatically close the issue once the
  pull request is merged.  If your PR will not completely solve the issue,
  please still reference the issue.

* Remember to add some description of your changes in this text box.

* If your pull request is not yet ready for review - either because
  you're just looking for feedback on a change or because you're not
  perfectly satisfied with your change - submit it as a draft pull request.
  Remember to change its' status once it's ready.

* If this is your first contribution, please add your name to the author
  list in `docs/about/credits.rst`.

* Feel free to chat with other developers on our Matrix channel at:
   https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org

* We have a developer's guide, where some answers to your questions may
  possibly be found, at
  http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/development/index.html

Many thanks in advance for following these pointers and for being willing to contribute!

When submitting a pull request, please ensure that you can (eventually,
sometime before it is merged) check the following basic requirements:

-->

- [ ] I have added a changelog entry for this pull request.

<!--

In short: changelog entries are short descriptions of your PR's changes
in `.rst` files in the `changelog` directory, named like
`<PULL REQUEST>.<TYPE>.rst`, where `<PULL
REQUEST>` is a pull request number, and `<TYPE>` is one of:

* `breaking`: A change which requires users to change code and is not backwards compatible. (Not to be used for removal of deprecated features.)
* `feature`: New user facing features and any new behavior.
* `bugfix`: Fixes a reported bug.
* `doc`: Documentation addition or improvement, like rewording an entire session or adding missing docs.
* `removal`: Feature deprecation and/or feature removal.
* `trivial`: A change which has no user facing effect or is tiny change.

You get the PR number when you submit it, so this part needs a follow-up
commit.
