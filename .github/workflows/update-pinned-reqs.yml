    # When a PR is created by a GitHub Action, normally the checks will
    # not be run. While the simplest workaround would have been to open
    # and close the PR, an alternative is to authenticate with GitHub
    # App generated tokens (as done below). The instructions for how to
    # do this are in the documentation for the create-pull-request
    # action.
