limit overhead and increase performance.

They act in-place on position and velocity arrays to reduce

def boris_push(x, v, B, E, q, m, dt):

    The explicit Boris pusher (non-relativistic)

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        particle position at full timestep, in SI (meter) units.
    v : np.ndarray
        particle velocity at half timestep, in SI (meter/second) units.
    B : np.ndarray
        magnetic field at full timestep, in SI (tesla) units.
    E : float
        electric field at full timestep, in SI (V/m) units.
    q : float
        particle charge, in SI (Coulomb) units.
    m : float
        particle mass, in SI (kg) units.
    dt : float
        timestep, in SI (second) units.

    Notes
    ----------
    The Boris algorithm is the standard energy conserving algorithm for
    particle movement in plasma physics. See [1]_ for more details, and
    [2]_ for a nice overview.

    Conceptually, the algorithm has three phases:

    1. Add half the impulse from electric field.
    2. Rotate the particle velocity about the direction of the magnetic
       field.
    3. Add the second half of the impulse from the electric field.

    This ends up causing the magnetic field action to be properly "centered" in
    time, and the algorithm, being a symplectic integrator, conserves energy.
