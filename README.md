An open source community developed Python 3.6+ package for plasma physics in
the early stages of development. PlasmaPy intends to be for plasmas what
[Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) is for astronomy - a
collection of functionality commonly used and shared between plasma physicists
and researchers globally, running within and leveraging the open source
scientific Python ecosystem. The goals of this project are more thoroughly described in our
[vision statement](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/stable/about/vision_statement.html)
and [an earlier conference poster](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.163752).
We are in the process of writing [online
documentation](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/).

We created a guide on
[contributing to PlasmaPy](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/master/CONTRIBUTING.html) and have a
[Code of Conduct](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).
New contributors are very welcome!

If you have any questions, the quickest way to get a response is to ask on our

channel.  You may also contact

## Installation

You can get PlasmaPy from pip via `pip install plasmapy`. To contribute to the package, check
out [our instructions on installing PlasmaPy from source](INSTALL.md).

We're not on Conda yet, but we're working on it!

Like most scientific Python packages, PlasmaPy probably runs best on the
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads).

PlasmaPy requires Python 3.6+ and is
[not compatible with Python 2](https://pythonclock.org/).
