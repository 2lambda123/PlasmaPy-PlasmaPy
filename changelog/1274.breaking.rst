Moved the charged particle radiography analysis codes into a new module `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography` containing synthetic radiography tools in `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography` and detector stack calculation tools in `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.detector_stacks`.
