Changed the project structure to an `src
layout <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/>`__
to follow the updated recommendation from the Python Packaging
Authority's `packaging guide <https://packaging.python.org/>`__. The
motivation for this change is described in :issue:`2581`. Source code
previously in :file:`plasmapy/` is now located in |src/plasmapy/| and
tests are now in a separate |tests/| directory. Tests previously in
:file:`plasmapy/**/tests/` are now in :file:`tests/**/`, where
:file:`**` refers to an arbitrary number of subdirectories. For example,
the source code of `plasmapy.formulary` is now located in
:file:`src/plasmapy/formulary/` and the tests for `plasmapy.formulary`
are now in :file:`tests/formulary/`.
