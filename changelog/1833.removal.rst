Removed ``plasmapy.formulary.parameters``, which was deprecated in
the ``0.7.0`` release.  The functionality in that module had previously
been migrated to modules that are broken down by physical type, such as:
`plasmapy.formulary.densities`, `plasmapy.formulary.dimensionless`,
`plasmapy.formulary.frequencies`, `plasmapy.formulary.lengths`,
`plasmapy.formulary.misc`, and `plasmapy.formulary.speeds`.
