Created a |tox| environment for regenerating requirements files used
in continuous integration (CI) and by integrated development environments
(IDEs). This environment is now what is being used in the automated pull
requests to regenerate requirements files. Switching from ``pip-compile``
to ``uv pip compile`` now allows requirements files to be created for multiple
versions of Python, as well as for minimal versions of dependencies.
