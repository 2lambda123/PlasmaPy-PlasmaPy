|IonicLevel| and |IonizationState| now accept an additional, optional ion
temperature argument for each of the ionic levels.  |IonizationState| can
now be sliced, returning a list of |IonicLevel| instances.
|IonizationState| now implements `len` (it's what you'd expect!).
|IonizationState| instances can now be compared to an
|IonizationState| of a different element without raising an exception.
