Added the ``save_results()`` function to `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiograph.Tracker` to save results to a `numpy.npz` file.
``synthetic_radiograph`` is now a separate function in the `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiograph` module that takes either a ``Tracker`` object or a result dictionary as an argument.
