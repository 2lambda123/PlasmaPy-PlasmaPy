Re-organized CSS_ files for the online documentation. The file
:file:`docs/_static/rtd_theme_overrides.css` was re-organized,
renamed to :file:`docs/_static/css/plasmapy.css`, and updated with
comments to help someone unfamiliar with CSS_ to understand the file and
syntax. The file
:file:`docs/_static/css/admonition_color_contrast.css` was added to
include color customizations for Sphinx_ admonitions that originally
came from
`sphinx_rtd_theme_ext_color_contrast
<https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/sphinx_rtd_theme_ext_color_contrast>`_.
