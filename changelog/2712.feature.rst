Added the ability to enable particle stopping in the |ParticleTracker|.
Added a ``return_interpolator`` keyword to `~plasmapy.particles.atomic.stopping_power` to allow the user to specify the return of an interpolator function (`~scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` under the hood).
Added the `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.misc.Bethe_stopping` function to the `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions` subpackage.
Changed default keyword argument for the ``fraction_exited_threshold`` in `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography.Tracker` and `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.termination_conditions.AllParticlesOffGridTerminationCondition` to correspond with the fraction of particles that have entered and subsequently exited the grids. Previously this keyword was a misnomer, causing the simulation to instead terminate when the specified fraction of particles remaining on the grids was less than or equal to the provided ``fraction_exited_threshold``.
