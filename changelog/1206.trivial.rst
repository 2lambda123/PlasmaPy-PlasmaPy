Updated tox_ test environments for building the documentation. Added the
``build_docs_nitpicky`` environment to check for broken reST_ links. Added
the ``--keep-going`` flag to the ``build_docs*`` tox_ environments with the
``-W`` option so that test failures will not stop after the first warning
(that is treated as an error).
