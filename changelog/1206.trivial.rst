Updated tox_ test environments for building the documentation.  Added the
``build_docs_nitpicky`` environment to check for broken reST_ links.  Enabled
automatic parallelization for all ``build_docs*`` environments.  Added the
``--keep-going`` flag to the ``build_docs*`` environments with the ``-W`` option
so that test failures will not stop after the first warning (that is treated as
an error).
