been deprecated in favor of objects named after the term "charge number".
The `~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.integer_charge`
attribute of |Particle| has been deprecated in favor of
`~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.charge_number`.
The `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonicLevel.integer_charge`
attribute of
|IonicLevel| (formerly ``IonicFraction``)
has been deprecated in favor of
`~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonicLevel.charge_number`.
The `~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.integer_charges`
attribute of |IonizationState| has been deprecated in favor of
`~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.charge_numbers`.
