In `plasmapy.particles`, use of the term "integer charge" has
been deprecated in favor of the term "charge number". The
`~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.integer_charge` attribute
of |Particle| has been deprecated in favor of
`~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.charge_number`. The
`~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonicLevel.integer_charge`
attribute of |IonicLevel| (formerly ``IonicFraction``) has been
deprecated in favor of
`~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonicLevel.charge_number`. The
`~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.integer_charges`
attribute of |IonizationState| has been deprecated in favor of
`~plasmapy.particles.ionization_state.IonizationState.charge_numbers`.
