Renamed the available "methods" for computing the Coulomb logarithm in an attempt
to make the names more explicit.  This is implemented using the ``method`` keyword
for functions `~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.Coulomb_logarithm` and
`~plasmapy.formulary.collisions.impact_parameter`, and then propogated throughout
the functionality in `plasmapy.formulary.collisions`.
