When instantiating a |Particle| representing an element or isotope with
no charge information provided, the
:attr:`~plasmapy.particles.particle_class.Particle.charge_number` will
now default to ``0``.  For example, ``Particle("H")`` will be equivalent
to ``Particle("H 0+")`` and ``Particle("H", Z=0)``. Previously,
``Particle("H").charge_number`` led to a |ChargeError|.
