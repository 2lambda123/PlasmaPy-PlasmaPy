The ``[all]`` option when using pip_ to install `plasmapy` is now
deprecated and may be removed in a future release. Packages that were
previously optional (including `h5py`, `lmfit`, |mpmath|_, and `numba`)
are now installed when running ``pip install plasmapy``. To install all
packages required for code development of PlasmaPy, instead run
``pip install plasmapy[developer]``.
