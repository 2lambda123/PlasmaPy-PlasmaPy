Added the `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.detector_stacks.Stack` and |Layer| objects to the `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography` module, which represent a stack of detector media layers. The `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.detector_stacks.Stack.deposition_curves` and `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.detector_stacks.Stack.energy_bands` methods of `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.detector_stacks.Stack` calculate the particle energies deposited in each detector layer.
