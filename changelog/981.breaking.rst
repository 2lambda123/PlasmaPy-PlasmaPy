Introduced persistence to interpolators, grid_resolution and quantities properties, on_grid and vector_intersect methods, and some small speed improvements to grids.py. Breaking changes: grid.grid is now dimensioned and cannot be accessed if all dimensions do not share the same units. grid.is_uniform_grid is now grid.is_uniform.
