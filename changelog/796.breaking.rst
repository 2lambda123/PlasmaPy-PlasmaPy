In ``plasmapy.particles``, rename the ``IonizationStates`` class to
``IonizationStateCollection`` and replace the ``State`` namedtuple with
the ``IonicFraction`` class.  When the ``IonizationState`` class is now
provided with an ion, the ionic fraction for that ion is set to 100% for
the corresponding element or isotope.
