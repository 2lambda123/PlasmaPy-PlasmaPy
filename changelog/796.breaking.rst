In `plasmapy.particles`, the ``IonizationStates`` class was renamed to
`~plasmapy.particles.IonizationStateCollection`.  The argument ``n`` in
``IonizationStates`` was changed to ``n0`` in
`~plasmapy.particles.IonizationStateCollection`.  The ``State`` namedtuple
was changed to the `~plasmapy.particles.IonicFraction` class.  When the
`~plasmapy.particles.IonizationState` class is now provided with an ion,
the ionic fraction for that ion is set to 100% for the corresponding
element or isotope.  ``AtomicError`` was renamed to
`~plasmapy.particles.exceptions.ParticleError` and ``MissingAtomicDataError``
was renamed to `~plasmapy.particles.exceptions.MissingParticleDataError`.
