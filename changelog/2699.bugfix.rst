Changed the z dependence of the ion contribution to the optical Thomson scattering
spectral density function in `~plasmapy.diagnostics.thomson.spectral_density_lite` from ``z``
to ``z^2 / zbar`` to match Eq. 5.1.2 and following equations in :cite:t:`sheffield:2011`. 
The result is a small change in the ion acoustic wave spectrum for plasmas
with multiple ion species.
