Created the Sphinx_ extension package `plasmapy_sphinx` and used it to replace
`sphinx_automodapi`_.  `plasmapy_sphinx` creates directives :rst:dir:`automodapi`
and :rst:dir:`automodsumm` to replace the same directives defined by
`sphinx_automodapi`_.  The documentation was updated so the slight syntax differences
in the newly defined directives will still render the same as before.
