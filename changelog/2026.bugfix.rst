Fixed an slight error in `~plasmapy.formulary.frequencies.plasma_frequency`
when the charge number was provided via ``z_mean`` (or now ``Z``) and
inconsistent with the charge number provided to ``particle`` (or zero,
if ``particle`` represented an element or isotope with no charge
information. Previously, if we represented a proton with
:py:`particle="H-1"` and :py:`z_mean=1`, then the mass used to calculate
the plasma frequency would have been the mass of a neutral hydrogen atom
rather than the mass of a proton. However, using :py:`particle="p+"`
would have produced the correct mass. This behavior has been corrected
by decorating this function with |particle_input|.
