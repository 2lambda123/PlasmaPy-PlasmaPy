If the first argument to |CustomParticle| (named ``mass``) is a |Quantity|
with units of charge, then the arguments ``charge`` and ``mass`` will be
switched. This allows |CustomParticle| to accept the charge and mass as the
first two positional arguments in either order, or to accept the charge as
the sole argument. Previously, providing the arguments in the incorrect
order resulted in an |InvalidParticleError|.
