Changed default keyword argument for the ``fraction_exited_threshold`` in `~plasmapy.diagnostics.charged_particle_radiography.synthetic_radiography.Tracker` and `~plasmapy.simulation.particle_tracker.termination_conditions.AllParticlesOffGridTerminationCondition` to correspond with the fraction of particles that have entered and subsequently exited the grids. Previously this keyword was a misnomer, causing the simulation to instead terminate when the specified fraction of particles remaining on the grids was less than or equal to the provided ``fraction_exited_threshold``.
