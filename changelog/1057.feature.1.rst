Expanded the functionality of the |particle_input| decorator to convert
|particle-like| and |particle-list-like| arguments into |Particle|,
|CustomParticle|, and |ParticleList| objects. This change is part of an
ongoing effort to improve compatibility of functions in subpackages like
`plasmapy.particles` and `plasmapy.formulary` with |CustomParticle| and
|ParticleList| objects.
