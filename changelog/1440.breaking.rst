Changed ``plasmapy.particles.elements`` to ``plasmapy.particles._elements``,
``plasmapy.particles.isotopes`` to ``plasmapy.particles._isotopes``,
``plasmapy.particles.parsing`` to ``plasmapy.particles._parsing``, and
``plasmapy.particles.special_particles`` to ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles``.
Most of these modules did not contain any objects that were part of the
public API, expect for ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles.ParticleZoo``
which was removed from the public API.
