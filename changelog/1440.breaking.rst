Renamed ``plasmapy.particles.elements`` to ``plasmapy.particles._elements``,
``plasmapy.particles.isotopes`` to ``plasmapy.particles._isotopes``,
``plasmapy.particles.parsing`` to ``plasmapy.particles._parsing``, and
``plasmapy.particles.special_particles`` to
``plasmapy.particles._special_particles``. The leading underscore
indicates that these modules are private (i.e. not considered part of
PlasmaPy's public API). Most of these did not contain any public
objects, except for ``plasmapy.particles.special_particles.ParticleZoo``
which was renamed to ``plasmapy.particles._special_particles.particle_zoo``
and removed from the public API.
