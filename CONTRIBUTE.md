# Contributing to PlasmaPy

There are numerous ways to contribute to PlasmaPy, including by
providing code and documentation, suggesting and discussing ideas,
submitting issues and bug reports, and engaging the broader plasma
physics community.  

## Sharing ideas

There are several methods of communication that are being used in the
early stages of PlasmaPy development:

* [Signing up for the PlasmaPy email
  list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy) will allow
  you to participate in broader discussions and keep up with .

* The [PlasmaPy repository on
  GitHub](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy) is the best place to
  [submit issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/issues) and
  review [pull requests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/pulls).

* The [PlasmaPy HipChat group](https://plasmapy.hipchat.com/chat) is a
  great place to have informal conversations and share ideas.  Before
  participating it is necessary to join the PlasmaPy team on HipChat
  (note: if you have another HipChat account, then you must use a
  different email address for this one).

* We have regularly scheduled telecons which are announced on the
  email list.
