# Contributing to PlasmaPy

There are numerous ways to contribute to PlasmaPy, including by
providing code and documentation, suggesting and discussing ideas,
submitting issues and bug reports, and engaging the broader plasma
physics community.  

## Sharing ideas

There are several methods of communication that are being used in the
early stages of PlasmaPy development:

* [Signing up for the PlasmaPy email
  list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy) will allow
  you to participate in broader discussions and keep up with .

* The [PlasmaPy repository on
  GitHub](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy) is the best place to
  [submit issues](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/issues) and
  review [pull requests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/plasmapy/pulls).

* The [PlasmaPy HipChat group](https://plasmapy.hipchat.com/chat) is a
  great place to have informal conversations and share ideas.  Before
  participating it is necessary to join the PlasmaPy team on HipChat
  (note: if you have another HipChat account, then you must use a
  different email address for this one).

* We have regularly scheduled telecons which are announced on the
  email list.

## Contributing code or documentation to PlasmaPy

Before contributing to the PlasmaPy code base, one must [**join
GitHub**](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).  A free account
will suffice for you to have unlimited public repositories.  If you
are new to [git](https://git-scm.com/), helpful resources include
documentation on [git
basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) and
an [interactive git
tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).  You must also
[install
git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
locally on your computer.

After creating your GitHub account, go to the [main
repository](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy) and **fork a copy of
PlasmaPy to your account**.

Next you must **clone your fork to your computer**.  Go to the
directory that will host your PlasmaPy directory.  Then run either
```
git clone https://github.com/namurphy/PlasmaPy.git
```
if you are using HTTPS, or 
```
git clone git@github.com:*your-username*/PlasmaPy.git
```
if you have previously [set up an SSH
key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).





Go to the forked repository in GitHub.  Select the option to clone or
download the repository, and copy the resulting path.  You may use SSH
(if you have previously )
or HTTPS.  Go to your computer to the directory you would like to put
the development version of PlasmaPy, and run 


Selecting the option of `Clone or download' will allow you to copy a
