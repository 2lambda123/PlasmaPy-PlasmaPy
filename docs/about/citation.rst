Acknowledging and Citing
========================

If you use PlasmaPy for a project that results in a research publication,
we ask that you cite the `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__ record for the
specific version of PlasmaPy used in your project.  Citing a software
package promotes scientific reproducibility, gives credit to its developers,
and highlights the importance of software as a vital research product.

.. |version_to_cite| replace:: 0.8.0
.. |doi_for_version| replace:: 10.5281/zenodo.6774350

Version |version_to_cite| of PlasmaPy may be cited with the following
reference:

   PlasmaPy Community et al. (2021). *PlasmaPy*, version |version_to_cite|,
   Zenodo, https://doi.org/\ |version_to_cite|

This reference may be made, for example, by adding the following line
to the methods or acknowledgements section of a paper.

   This research made use of PlasmaPy version |version_to_cite|, a community-developed
   open source Python package for plasma science (PlasmaPy Community et al.
   2021).

A paper written using `AASTeX <https://journals.aas.org/aastexguide>`__
use the ``\software{PlasmaPy}`` command to cite PlasmaPy.

All public releases of PlasmaPy, as well as many informational resources
on PlasmaPy, are openly archived in the
`PlasmaPy Community <https://zenodo.org/communities/plasmapy>`__
on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org>`__.

We encourage authors to acknowledge the packages that PlasmaPy
depends on, including but not limited to
`Astropy <https://www.astropy.org/acknowledging.html>`__,
`NumPy <https://numpy.org/citing-numpy>`__, and
`SciPy <https://scipy.org/citing-scipy>`__.

Note that a development version of PlasmaPy should NOT be cited or used in published work.
