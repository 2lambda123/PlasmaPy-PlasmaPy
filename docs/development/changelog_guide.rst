Changelog Guide

A changelog tells users and contributors what notable changes have been
made between each release.

Creating a changelog entry
--------------------------

Each changelog entry should be created after a pull request to the main
branch has been made. If the change is sufficiently minor (e.g., a typo
fix), then a package maintainer will add the "No changelog entry needed"
label.
