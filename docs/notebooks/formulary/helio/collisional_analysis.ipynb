    "This notebook will introduce and demonstrate collisional analysis, the functionality is contained in the [collisional_analysis()][coal] module. Collisional analysis, first introduced by [Maruca 2013][maruca2013], uses the idea that Coulomb collisions â€” \"soft,\" small-angle deflections mediated by the electrostatic force, act to erode non-local thermal equilibrium (LTE) features within the solar wind. Though remnants may persist through much of the inner heliosphere and beyond, this results in strong departures from LTE.\n",
