    "Charged particle radiographs are often recorded on detector stacks with multiple layers (often either radiochromic film or CR39 plastic). Since charged particles deposit most of their energy at a depth related to their energy (the [Bragg peak]), each detector layer records a different energy band of particles. The energy bands recorded on each layer are further discriminated by including layers of filter material (eg. thin strips of aluminum) between the active layers. In order to analyze this data, it is necessary to calculate what range of particle energies are stopped in each detector layer.\n",
