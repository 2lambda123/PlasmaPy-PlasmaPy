Installing Python
=================

PlasmaPy requires Python_ 3.8 or newer. If you do not have Python
installed already, please follow these instructions to `download
Python`_ and install it.

.. tip::

   If you have trouble installing PlasmaPy on the most recent version of
   Python between October and âˆ¼December (e.g., 3.11), try installing it
   on the second most recent version (e.g., 3.10). New versions of
   Python are released annually in October, and it sometimes takes time
   before the scientific Python ecosystem catches up.

.. _install-pip:

Installation with pip
=====================

To install the most recent release of `plasmapy` on PyPI_ with pip_ into
an existing Python 3.8+ environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install plasmapy

On some systems, it might be necessary to use ``pip3`` instead of
``pip``. For more detailed information, please refer to this tutorial on
`installing packages`_.

.. _install-conda:

Installation with Conda
=======================

Conda_ can also be used to install `plasmapy` into a Python environment.
Conda_ allows us to create and switch between Python environments that
are isolated from each other and the system installation (in contrast to
`this xkcd <https://xkcd.com/1987>`_).

After `installing conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_,
create a PlasmaPy environment with all required and optional dependencies
by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n env_name python plasmapy -c conda-forge

where ``env_name`` is replaced by the name of the environment.
To activate this environment, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate env_name

Installation from source code
=============================

Obtaining source code
---------------------

Official releases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ZIP_ file containing the source code for official releases of
`plasmapy` can be obtained `from PyPI`_ or `from Zenodo`_.

.. Discuss unzipping here

GitHub repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have git_ installed on your computer, you may clone
`PlasmaPy's GitHub repository`_ and access source code
from the most recent development version by running:

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy.git

The repository will be cloned inside a new subdirectory called
:file:`PlasmaPy`.

If you do not have git_ installed on your computer, then you may download
the most recent source code from `PlasmaPy's GitHub repository`_ by
going to :guilabel:`Code` and selecting :guilabel:`Download ZIP`.
`Unzipping <https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File>`__ the file will
create a subdirectory called :file:`PlasmaPy` that contains the source
code.


Building and installing
-----------------------

To install the downloaded version of PlasmaPy, enter the
:file:`PlasmaPy` directory and run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install .

If you expect to make any changes to code within PlasmaPy, instead run:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e .[developer]

The ``-e`` flag makes the installation editable and ``[developer]``
indicates that all of the dependencies needed for developing PlasmaPy
will be installed.

.. note::

   The :ref:`contributing-to-plasmapy` guide has instructions on how to
   fork a repository and create branches so that you may make pull
   requests.
